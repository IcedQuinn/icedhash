== Spooky V2

WARNING: SpookyV2 hashes are currently broken in this version.

=== API

* `import icedhash/spooky2`

==== One-shot

[source,nim]
----
proc spooky2*(output, input, key: pointer;
              outlen, inlen, keylen: uint)
----

Process an entire message in one sequential pass.

* *output, outlen*. Buffer to store the finished digest. Length must be
between one and eight bytes.
* *key, keylen*. Buffer holding the key for salting. Can be up to eight
bytes.

It should be repeated that Spooky V2 is _not a cryptographic hash_ so
salting is not equivalent to MAC signing (as it is with Blake.) It is
still useful if you need to make hash collisions a bit less predictable.

==== Streaming

The streaming API is for data which is processed in chunks. It works
like this:

* Call `init` to prepare a state object,
* Call `update` to feed data to the hasher as it comes in,
* Call `final` when you are done.
