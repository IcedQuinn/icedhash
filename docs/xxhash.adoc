== XXHash

XXHash is a non-cryptographic hash by
https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash[Yann Collet].

A streaming interface is supported but the general intended use for XXHash
is through the one-shot `xxh32` or `xxh64` procedures.

Unlike Spooky and Blake the output size of a hash is always fixed by
which version of the algorithm you use. `xxh32` creates 32-bit hashes
and `xxh64` creates 64-bit hashes.

=== API

- `import icedhash/xxhash`

==== One-shot

[source,nim]
----
proc xxh32*(input: pointer; len: int; seed: XXH32_hash): XXH32_hash
proc xxh64*(input: pointer; len: int; seed: XXH64_hash): XXH64_hash
----

Process an entire message in one sequential pass.

- *input*. Pointer to the first byte to be hashed.
- *len*. Number of bytes to be hashed.
- *seed*. A seed, salt, or key. Allows different hash results for the same
input.

NOTE: As a _non-cryptographic_ hash this is more reliable for probablistic
algorithms which need more than one hash per object, or as a thin layer of
security to make it harder for attackers to design malicious payloads.
It should not be used in place of a proper MAC.

==== Streaming

The streaming API is for data which is processed in chunks. It works
like this:

- Call `init` to prepare a state object,
- Call `update` to feed data to the hasher as it comes in,
- Call `final` when you are done.

proc init*(statePtr: var XXH32_state;
