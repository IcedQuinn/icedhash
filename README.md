`icedhash` is a collection of cryptographic and non-cryptographic
hashing routines which have been ported to native Nim.

# Hashes

## Blake 2

### API

-   `import icedhash/blake2b` for blake2b.

-   `import icedhash/blake2s` for blake2s.

#### One-shot

``` nim
proc blake2b*(output, input, key: pointer;
              outlen, inlen, keylen: uint)
proc blake2s*(output, input, key: pointer;
              outlen, inlen, keylen: uint)
```

Process an entire message in one sequential pass.

-   **output, outlen**. Buffer to store the finished digest. Length must
    be between one and sixty-four bytes for 2b, or one and thirty-two
    bytes for 2s.

-   **input, inlen**. Buffer holding the message to hash. Can be nil
    (but why?) Length must be between zero and sixty-four bytes for 2b,
    or one and thirty-two bytes for 2s.

-   **key, keylen**. Buffer holding the key for MAC signing. Can be nil.

#### Streaming

The streaming API is for data which is processed in chunks. It works
like this:

-   Call `init` to prepare a state object,

-   Call `update` to feed data to the hasher as it comes in,

-   Call `final` when you are done.

``` nim
proc init*  (S: var Blake2bState;
             outlen: uint64;
             key: pointer = nil;
             keylen: uint = 0)
proc init*  (S: var Blake2sState;
             outlen: uint64;
             key: pointer = nil;
             keylen: uint = 0)
```

``` nim
proc update*(S: var Blake2bState;
             input: pointer;
             inlen: uint)
proc update*(S: var Blake2sState;
             input: pointer;
             inlen: uint)
```

``` nim
proc final* (S: var Blake2bState;
             layer_last: bool;
             output: pointer;
             outlen: uint)
proc final* (S: var Blake2sState;
             layer_last: bool;
             output: pointer;
             outlen: uint)
```

#### Advanced

``` nim
proc init*(S: var Blake2bState;
           P: var Blake2bParam)
proc init*(S: var Blake2sState;
           P: var Blake2sParam)
```

Used instead of other `init` procs when you want to specify all of the
Blake parameters yourself. You might need to do this for tree hashing
modes or to include custom salts.

``` nim
proc lastblock*(self: var Blake2bState): bool
proc lastblock*(self: var Blake2sState): bool
```

``` nim
proc `lastblock=`*(self: var Blake2bState;
                   b: bool)
proc `lastblock=`*(self: var Blake2sState;
                   b: bool)
```

You donâ€™t *normally* need to set this as it will be done in the call to
`final`.

``` nim
proc lastnode*(self: var Blake2bState): bool
proc lastnode*(self: var Blake2sState): bool
```

``` nim
proc `lastnode=`*(self: var Blake2bState;
                  b: bool)
proc `lastnode=`*(self: var Blake2sState;
                  b: bool)
```

If you are using Blake for tree hashing, you set this to `true` before
calling `final` when dealing with the last sibling in a particular
subtree.

## Blake 3

Patches welcome.

## XXHash

XXHash is a non-cryptographic hash by [Yann
Collet](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash).

A streaming interface is supported but the general intended use for
XXHash is through the one-shot `xxh32` or `xxh64` procedures.

Unlike Spooky and Blake the output size of a hash is always fixed by
which version of the algorithm you use. `xxh32` creates 32-bit hashes
and `xxh64` creates 64-bit hashes.

### API

-   `import icedhash/xxhash`

#### One-shot

``` nim
proc xxh32*(input: pointer; len: int; seed: XXH32_hash): XXH32_hash
proc xxh64*(input: pointer; len: int; seed: XXH64_hash): XXH64_hash
```

Process an entire message in one sequential pass.

-   **input**. Pointer to the first byte to be hashed.

-   **len**. Number of bytes to be hashed.

-   **seed**. A seed, salt, or key. Allows different hash results for
    the same input.

<div class="note">

As a *non-cryptographic* hash this is more reliable for probablistic
algorithms which need more than one hash per object, or as a thin layer
of security to make it harder for attackers to design malicious
payloads. It should not be used in place of a proper MAC.

#### Streaming

The streaming API is for data which is processed in chunks. It works
like this:

-   Call `init` to prepare a state object,

-   Call `update` to feed data to the hasher as it comes in,

-   Call `final` when you are done.

``` nim
proc init*(statePtr: var XXH32_state;
           seed: XXH32_hash): XXH_errorcode

proc init*(statePtr: var XXH64_state;
           seed: XXH64_hash): XXH_errorcode
```

``` nim
proc update*(state: var XXH32_state;
             input: pointer;
             len: int): XXH_errorcode
proc update*(state: var XXH64_state;
             input: pointer;
             len: int): XXH_errorcode
```

``` nim
proc final*(state: var XXH32_state): XXH32_hash
proc final*(state: var XXH64_state): XXH64_hash
```
